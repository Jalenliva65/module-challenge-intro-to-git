## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? An open source distributed version control system
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code, while GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources.
3. Why do we create a branch? Allows us to isolate our work from other team members
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Lets you review differences between branches
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git switch
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? fetch fetches update but does not merge them, git merge lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch, git pull lets you fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 
7. What is a merge conflict? competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Navigate into the affected file, generate a list of files affected by the conflict, figure out what changes are going to be made, add or stage changes, commit your changes with a comment
